Based on the provided data, the following immutable business laws should guide future decisions:

*   **Insight**: There is currently no transaction data.
*   **Rule**: Before any analysis or strategic decision-making can occur, transaction data collection and storage must be implemented and verified. This is the foundational requirement for all future business intelligence.
*   **Warning**: Attempting to formulate strategies or make business decisions without data is detrimental and will likely lead to inaccurate or misguided actions.

Since there are no transactions, there is no way to identify what leads to success, conditions that lead to higher order values or what should be avoided.
