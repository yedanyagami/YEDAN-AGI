## 🟢 VERIFIED_HIGH_YIELD (Replicate these Patterns)
| ID | Sector | Pattern Name | Logic / Trigger | Yield Factor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PAT-001** | SaaS/Dev | **The "Engineer's Savior"** | Don't sell the product. Sell the *code snippet* that fixes the bug, then offer the tool as a "Lazy Button". | **Pending Data** |
| **PAT-002** | Gumroad | **"Fear Setting" Copy** | Focus 80% on the loss ($10k error) and 20% on the solution. "Peace of Mind" sells better than "Features". | **Pending Data** |
| **PAT-003** | Global | **The 10k Consensus** | 1. **SKU-First**: Primary Key must be SKU, not Shopify ID. <br> 2. **No Polling**: Use Webhooks (`orders/paid`) only. <br> 3. **Matrixify-Ready**: All exports must be compatible with Matrixify CSV format. | **HIGH (Universal)** |

## 🔴 DEPRECATED (Do Not Repeat)
| ID | Sector | Pattern Name | Failure Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DEP-001** | General | **Generic "Check this out"** | Low CTR on Reddit. Triggers spam filters immediately. |

## 🔄 EXPERIMENTAL_QUEUE (To Be Tested)
1.  **Hypothesis:** Adding "Open Source" to the title increases click-through by 40% on Developer subreddits.
2.  **Hypothesis:** Changing Gumroad button from "I want this" to "Secure My Store" increases checkout conversion.
