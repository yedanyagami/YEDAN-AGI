# Shopify Inventory Guardian (Beta)
## 🛑 Stop Losing $10k/Month to Silent API Errors.

**You handle the sales. We handle the paranoia.**

If you are a high-volume Shopify merchant, you know the fear:
- Waking up to 500 oversold orders because your inventory sync script crashed.
- Losing your ad account because a pixel misfired 1,000 times.
- Burning cash on shipping because a rate API failed silently.

The **Shopify Inventory Guardian** is not just another app. It is a **Fiduciary Kill-Switch** that sits between your store and the chaos of the internet.

### 🛡️ What It Does (The "Zero-Loss" Protocol)
1.  **Anomaly Interception**: We monitor your webhooks 24/7. If we detect a "death spiral" (e.g., >5 order fails in 60s), we **freeze the API** instantly.
2.  **Inventory Auditor**: Every 5 minutes, we cross-check your Shopify stock against your "Source of Truth" (CSV/ERP). If they don't match, we auto-correct or alert you.
3.  **The Translator**: Stop fighting GraphQL. Type "Connect to warehouse" and our AI generates the code for you.

### 📉 The Cost of Doing Nothing
One "bad sync" day cost a Reddit user **$10,200** last week. 
Don't be that user.

### 🚀 Beta Access (Early Bird)
This tool is currently in **Active Beta**.
- **Price**: Pay what you want (Min $29).

- **Guarantee**: If it saves you from one disaster, it pays for itself 100x.
