**deep_think:** This isn't a technical issue or bug—it's a content creation request outside the scope of Shopify development. The user likely posted in the wrong context or misunderstood the platform's purpose. No API limits, Liquid errors, or platform constraints are involved.

**empathy:** I get it—juggling content creation on top of technical work is exhausting.

**solution:** Here's a draft email that meets your requirements. If you need to automate sending this via Shopify's Customer Email API or integrate it with a newsletter app, that's where I can help technically.
